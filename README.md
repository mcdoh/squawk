# Squawk!

A short-term, short-url, that can be shared with a word.

I was sad to see that ShoutKey was shut down. Short-term links and a url that can be conveyed with a word ~shouted~ squawked across a room really come in handy. Building a ShoutKey clone proved to be a great first Elixir/Phoenix project.
